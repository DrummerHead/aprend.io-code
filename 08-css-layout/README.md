## Please note

Analyze this code keeping in mind that the objective here is to create a set of reusable wireframe-like modules with the purpose of exemplifying the different layout possibilities in CSS.

Don't base an actual layout system on the class-heavy usage of this example.

Also, data-style attributes with JS is being eval interpreted. We can do this in this example because we have complete control of the code. Doing this on a user-facing app is discouraged.
